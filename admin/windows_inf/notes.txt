1. Unplug the device(s) from the system.  

2. Open the Windows Device Manager and remove all incorrectly
   installed USB devices (device entries with a yellow exclamation
   mark).

3. Reconnect the device(s) to the system.  

4. When Windows asks for a driver, choose the inf-file(s) created
   above. On Win2k and WinXP systems, Windows will warn that the
   driver is is not 'digitally signed'. Ignore this message and
   continue with the installation.

5. Open the Windows Device Manager to verify that the device is
   installed correctly. Run the test program (testlibusb-win.exe) from
   the 'bin directory'. It should print out the descriptors of your
   device(s).

# A reboot isn't necessary.
